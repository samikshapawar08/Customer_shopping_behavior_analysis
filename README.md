**👩🏻‍🎓 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis | Data Analytics Portfolio Project**

This repository contains my **first hands-on Data Analytics portfolio project**, created as part of my learning journey in Data Analytics.  
As a student, my objective was to apply concepts of **Python, SQL, and Power BI** on a real-world dataset and understand how an **end-to-end analytics workflow** is executed in professional environments.

This project focuses on converting raw customer transaction data into meaningful insights that can support business decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The main goals of this project were to:

- Practice real-world **data cleaning and preprocessing**
- Perform **business-oriented data analysis using SQL**
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard**
- Learn how to **communicate insights** through reports and visualizations

This project helped me connect theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.

## 📌 Project Overview
The dataset contains approximately **3,900 customer purchase records** across multiple product categories.

Through this project, I analyzed:
- Customer demographics and spending behavior
- Subscription vs non-subscription purchasing patterns
- Impact of discounts and shipping types
- Product performance and customer loyalty

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1️⃣ **Data Preparation & EDA (Python)**  
- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Cleaned data and handled missing values  
- Performed feature engineering (age groups, purchase frequency)

2️⃣ **Business Analysis (SQL – PostgreSQL)**  
- Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL  
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze revenue, customer segments, and purchase behavior

3️⃣ **Data Visualization (Power BI)**  
- Built an interactive dashboard  
- Visualized revenue trends, customer segmentation, and product performance

4️⃣ **Reporting & Insights**  
- Summarized key findings  
- Provided business insights and recommendations
